Textbooks
---------

There is no required textbook for the course, although students are expected to complete the assigned readings.

Two recommended books are:

Smits, A. J. _A Physical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 1999. ISBN: 9780471253495.

White, F. _Fluid Mechanics_. 5th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 2002. ISBN: 9780072831801.

Course Organization
-------------------

Weekly problem sets will be assigned and are due the following week unless otherwise noted. **Homework solutions are expected to be the result of individual effort**. However, group discussions of the concepts covered on the homework and review of the course material is encouraged.

Laboratory projects and reports should also be done individually. While the data will be the result of a collective effort, the final processing and analysis should be done individually unless otherwise noted. Lab assignments will be due on the date specified on the lab hand-out. Pre-lab exercises should be done prior to coming to class and can be done collectively.

There will be two exams administered in class and a final exam scheduled during exam week. Partial credit will be given on all problems, except multiple choice and fill in the blank type questions.
